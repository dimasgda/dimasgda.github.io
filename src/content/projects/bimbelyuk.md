description: 'A marketing-focused landing page for BimbelYuk, an online tutoring startup'
---

A responsive and performance-optimized landing page developed to promote BimbelYuk, an educational startup offering online tutoring services. The page highlights the platform's value propositions, guides users through the registration process, and provides contact information for further inquiries.

## Client's Challenges
---
As a newly established online tutoring startup, BimbelYuk needed a clear and persuasive landing page to introduce their services, build credibility, and convert visitors into registered users. At the time, they had no online presence to serve as a marketing funnel or lead generator.

## Solution
---
Collaborating closely with a UI designer, I developed a landing page that includes:
- **Service Highlights:** Clearly articulated advantages of BimbelYuk's online tutoring programs.
- **Registration Guide:** A step-by-step visual explanation to help users easily register and join the platform.
- **Contact Section:** Direct contact information and CTA elements for inquiries or support.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop to ensure accessibility and performance across all devices.

The result is a conversion-oriented landing page that effectively communicates the brand's value and encourages user action.

## Tech Stack
---
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel
