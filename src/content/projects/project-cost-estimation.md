title: 'Project Cost Estimation & RAB Tool'
year: 2025
description: 'An internal tool developed for CV. Ragapool Asia to automate project cost estimation (RAB) and quotations (SPH)'
---

An internal web application built for **CV. Ragapool Asia**, a company operating in the construction and infrastructure sector, to streamline the process of calculating project costs, generating detailed cost plans (RAB), and preparing official price quotations (SPH). This tool was designed to support the company's operational scalability as their client base continued to grow.

## Client's Challenges
---
Prior to this project, CV. Ragapool Asia relied heavily on manual spreadsheets to perform cost estimations and generate RAB and SPH documents. As the number of clients and projects increased, the spreadsheet-based approach became inefficient, and difficult to maintainâ€”especially in terms of managing up-to-date prices, labor data, and consistent documentation.

## Solution
---
I developed a dedicated internal application tailored to the workflow and needs of CV. Ragapool Asia. The system introduced structured data handling and automation with the following key features:

- **Master Data Management:** Centralized management of workers (tukang), equipment, and materials for consistent and accurate cost calculation.
- **AHSP Management:** Creation and management of Analisa Harga Satuan Pekerjaan (unit price analysis)
- **Project Management Module:** Allows users to define new projects and generate:
  - **RAB (Rencana Anggaran Biaya):** Detailed cost estimates exportable to Excel format.
  - **SPH (Surat Penawaran Harga):** Price quotation documents for clients based on selected components of the project.

The solution significantly reduced the risk of calculation errors, improved team efficiency, and enabled the company to scale its project handling capabilities with better accuracy and accountability.
