description: 'A legal document management system with approval workflows for the Health Department of Kediri City'
---

A web-based system developed for the Health Department of Kediri City to streamline the management, approval, and categorization of internal legal documents. This platform enables efficient tracking and handling of regulatory documents across multiple organizational roles.

## Client's Challenges
---
The Health Department of Kediri City needed a dedicated platform to manage their internal legal documents. Previously, document handling was fragmented, lacked version control, and was difficult to monitor through different approval stages. There was no centralized system for tracking the progress of legal documents or managing roles and responsibilities within the workflow.

## Solution
---
I developed a document management system tailored to the department’s workflow, with key features including:

- **Document Status Tracking:** Track documents across various stages *submitted*, *revision*, and *approved*.  
- **Approval Workflow:** Documents can be reviewed and approved by the head of the department through a structured interface.  
- **User Management:** Admins can manage roles and permissions across different internal users.  
- **Document Categories:** Support for custom categorization to better organize different types of legal documents.

This solution improved visibility, accountability, and turnaround time for legal documentation within the department.

## Tech Stack
---
- **Backend:** Laravel 11
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Inertia
- **Architecture:**  Single Page Application (SPA) with Laravel server-side routing
- **Deployment:** VPS
