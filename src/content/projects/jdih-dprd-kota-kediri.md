year: 2024
description: 'A digital Legal Documentation and Information system for DPRD of Kediri City'
---

A digital Legal Documentation and Information (JDIH) system  developed to support the efficient and structured management and publication of legal documents for the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) of Kediri City.

## Client's Challenges
---
At the time of development in 2024, the DPRD of Kediri City did not have an official digital platform to manage and disseminate legal documents such as regional regulations, monographs, and legal articles. Documentation processes were still handled manually, making it difficult to search, distribute, and provide public access to legal information that should be transparent and readily available.

## Solution
---
I designed and developed an integrated website featuring:
- **Legal Document Management:** Upload, categorize, and publish legal documents including regulations, monographs, and articles.
- **News:** To document DPRD activities and share public information.
- **Search & Filtering Features:** To help users easily locate documents or news based on categories, publication year, or keywords.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for internal staff to manage content efficiently.
  
This solution enabled DPRD Kediri to digitize their legal documentation processes and extend public access to critical legal information through a centralized online platform.

## Tech Stack
---
- **Backend:** Laravel 11
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Inertia
- **Architecture:**  Single Page Application (SPA) with Laravel server-side routing
- **Deployment:** VPS
