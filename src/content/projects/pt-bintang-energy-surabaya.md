A company website and content management system (CMS) developed for **PT Bintang Energy Surabaya**, an energy solutions provider, with the goal of enhancing their online presence and supporting their marketing efforts. The platform includes a public-facing landing page and a robust admin panel for managing dynamic content.

## Client's Challenges
---
PT Bintang Energy Surabaya needed a digital platform to market their products, services, and company updates. Prior to this project, they had no centralized system to manage website content, nor a streamlined way to connect customers with their sales team.

## Solution

I developed a comprehensive CMS-based website tailored to their operational and marketing needs, with features including:

- **Product & Service Management:** Admins can easily manage product and service listings, each equipped with a **WhatsApp order button** to facilitate direct customer inquiries.
- **Article Management:** A blog-style module for publishing company news, educational content, and promotional materials.
- **Landing Page:** A responsive, SEO-optimized homepage designed to communicate their brand value and drive user engagement.
- **Admin Panel:** A secure and intuitive backend interface for managing content without technical knowledge.

The integration of SEO best practices helped improve their online discoverability, while the WhatsApp ordering feature created a seamless path from interest to inquiry.
